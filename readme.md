## What I Learnt

Here I got a chance to explore more about tailwind CSS which is a CSS framework. Understood the work flow of the framework and providing manual values to classes was super cool. We can have almost control on the classes it provides. I explored width, padding, margin, background, position, background image, media-queries and a lot more classes provided by the framework to get this project up and runningðŸ˜ƒ.
